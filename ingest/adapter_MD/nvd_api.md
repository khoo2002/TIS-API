Vulnerabilities

This documentation assumes that you already understand at least one common programming language and are generally familiar with JSON RESTful services.

JSON specifies the format of the data returned by the REST service.

REST refers to a style of services that allow computers to communicate via HTTP over the Internet.

Click here for a list of best practices and additional information on where to start.

The NVD is also documenting popular workflows to assist developers working with the APIs.

CVE API
The CVE API is used to easily retrieve information on a single CVE or a collection of CVE from the NVD. The NVD contains 306,396 CVE records. Because of this, its APIs enforce offset-based pagination to answer requests for large collections. Through a series of smaller "chunked" responses controlled by an offset startIndex and a page limit resultsPerPage users may page through all the CVE in the NVD.

The URL stem for retrieving CVE information is shown below.

Base URL

Parameters
cpeName (optional)
This parameter returns all CVE associated with a specific CPE. The exact value provided with cpeName is compared against the CPE Match Criteria within a CVE applicability statement. If the value of cpeName is considered to match, the CVE is included in the results.

A CPE Name is a string of characters comprised of 13 colon separated values that describe a product. In CPEv2.3 the first two values are always "cpe" and "2.3". The values that follow are referred to as the CPE components. When filtering by cpeName the part, vendor, product, and version components are REQUIRED to contain a value.

CPE Match Criteria comes in two forms: CPE Match Strings and CPE Match String Ranges. Both are abstract concepts that are then correlated to CPE URIS in the Official CPE Dictionary. Unlike a CPE Name, match strings and match string ranges do not require a value in the part, vendor, product, or version components.

Request all CVE containing an OVAL record

https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0?hasOval


isVulnerable (optional)
This parameter returns only CVE associated with a specific CPE, where the CPE is also considered vulnerable. The exact value provided with cpeName is compared against the CPE Match Criteria within a CVE applicability statement. If the value of cpeName is considered to match, and is also considered vulnerable the CVE is included in the results.

If filtering by isVulnerable, cpeName is REQUIRED. Please note, virtualMatchString is not accepted in requests that use isVulnerable.

Request all CVE associated a specific CPE and are marked as vulnerable

https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0?cpeName=cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_10:1607&isVulnerable


kevStartDate & kevEndDate (optional)
{kevStartDate}

{kevEndDate}

These parameters return only the CVEs that were added to the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog during the specified period. If a CVE was added outside of the specified window, it will not be included. A CVE's kevDate reflects the date it was added to the KEV catalog.

When filtering by KEV inclusion dates, both kevStartDate and kevEndDate are REQUIRED.

Values must be entered in the extended ISO-8601 date/time format:
[YYYY] ["-"] [MM]["-"][DD]["T"] [HH][":"] [MM][":"] [SS][Z]

The "T" separates the date from the time. The "Z" indicates optional offset-from-UTC. If a positive offset is used (e.g., +01:00 for CET), encode the "+" as "%2B". Most user agents will handle this automatically.

Request all CVE records added to the KEV catalog between the start and end datetimes

https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0/?kevStartDate=2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z&kevEndDate=2023-04-30T23:59:59.999Z


keywordExactMatch (optional)
By default, keywordSearch returns any CVE where a word or phrase is found in the current description. If the value of keywordSearch is a phrase, i.e., contains more than one term, including keywordExactMatch returns only the CVEs matching the phrase (without it, the results will contain records having any of the terms). If filtering by keywordExactMatch, keywordSearch is REQUIRED. Please note, this parameter is provided without a value.

Request all CVE mentioning the exact phrase "Microsoft Outlook"

https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0?keywordSearch=Microsoft Outlook&keywordExactMatch


Please note, the example above would not return a CVE unless the exact phrase "Microsoft Outlook" appears in the current description.

keywordSearch (optional)
{keyword(s)}

This parameter returns only the CVEs where a word or phrase is found in the current description. Descriptions associated with CVE are maintained by the CVE Program through coordination with CVE Numbering Authorities (CNAs). The NVD has no control over CVE descriptions.

Please note, empty spaces in the URL should be encoded in the request as "%20". The user agent may handle this encoding automatically. Multiple keywords function as an 'AND' statement. This returns results where all keywords exist somewhere in the current description, though not necessarily together. Keyword search operators are limited to suffix matching, where an asterisk (*) is placed after each keyword provided. For example, providing "circle" will return results such as "circles" but not "encircle".

Request any CVE mentioning "Microsoft"

https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0?keywordSearch=Microsoft


Request any CVE mentioning "Windows", "MacOs", and "Debian"

https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0?keywordSearch=Windows MacOs Linux


lastModStartDate & lastModEndDate (optional)
{start date}

{end date}

These parameters return only the CVEs that were last modified during the specified period. If a CVE has been modified more recently than the specified period it will not be included in the response.

If filtering by the last modified date, both lastModStartDate and lastModEndDate are REQUIRED. The maximum allowable range when using these parameters is 120 consecutive days.

A CVE's lastModified changes when any of the follow actions occur:

The NVD publishes the new CVE record

The NVD changes the status of a published CVE record after it has been analyzed

A source (CVE Primary CNA or another CNA) modifies a published CVE record

A CVE's lastModified does not change when any of the follow actions occur:

The NVD changes the status of a newly published CVE record to "Undergoing Analysis"

The NVD modifies a CPE record previously associated with the CVE record

Values must be entered in the extended ISO-8601 date/time format:
[YYYY]["-"] [MM]["-"][DD]["T"] [HH][":"][MM][":"] [SS] [Z]

The "T" is a literal to separate the date from the time. The Z indicates an optional offset-from-UTC. Please note, if a positive Z value is used (such as +01:00 for Central European Time) then the "+" should be encoded in the request as "%2B". The user agent may handle this encoding automatically.

Request all CVE records modified between the start and end datetimes

https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0/?lastModStartDate=2021-08-04T13:00:00.000%2B01:00&lastModEndDate=2021-10-22T13:36:00.000%2B01:00


noRejected (optional)
By default, the CVE API includes CVE records with the REJECT or Rejected status. This parameter excludes CVE records with the REJECT or Rejected status. Please note, this parameter is provided without a parameter value.

Request all CVE without the REJECT or Rejected status

https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0?noRejected


pubStartDate & pubEndDate (optional)
{start date}

{end date}

These parameters return only the CVEs that were added to the NVD (i.e., published) during the specified period. If filtering by the published date, both pubStartDate and pubEndDate are REQUIRED. The maximum allowable range when using any date range parameters is 120 consecutive days.

Values must be entered in the extended ISO-8601 date/time format:
[YYYY]["-"] [MM]["-"][DD]["T"] [HH][":"] [MM][":"] [SS] [Z]

The "T" is a literal to separate the date from the time. The Z indicates an optional offset-from-UTC. Please note, if a positive Z value is used (such as +01:00) then the "+" should be encoded in the request as "%2B". The user agent may handle this encoding automatically.

Request all CVE published between the start and end dates, defaulting to GMT

https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0/?pubStartDate=2021-08-04T00:00:00.000&pubEndDate=2021-10-22T00:00:00.000


Request all CVE published between the start and end datetimes

https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0/?pubStartDate=2020-01-01T00:00:00.000-05:00&pubEndDate=2020-01-31T23:59:59.999-05:00


resultsPerPage (optional)
{page limit}

This parameter specifies the maximum number of CVE records to be returned in a single API response. For network considerations, the default value and maximum value is 2,000. It is recommended that users of the CVE API use the default resultsPerPage value. This value has been optimized to allow the greatest number of results while minimizing the number of requests.

startIndex (optional)
{offset}

This parameter specifies the index of the first CVE to be returned in the response data. The index is zero-based, meaning the first CVE is at index zero.

The CVE API returns four primary objects in the response body that are used for pagination: resultsPerPage, startIndex, totalResults, and vulnerabilities. The totalResults indicates the total number of CVE records that match the request parameters. If the value of totalResults is greater than the value of resultsPerPage, the request returned more records than could be returned by a single API response and additional requests must update the startIndex to get the remaining records.

The best, most efficient, practice for keeping up to date with the NVD is to use the date range parameters to request only the CVEs that have been modified or published in the last 120 days.

Request 20 CVE records, beginning at index 0 and ending at index 19

https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0/?resultsPerPage=20&startIndex=0


Request the CVE records, beginning at index 20 and ending at index 39

https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0/?resultsPerPage=20&startIndex=20


sourceIdentifier (optional)
{sourceIdentifier}

This parameter returns CVE where the exact value of {sourceIdentifier} appears as a data source in the CVE record. The CVE API returns sourceIdentifier values in the descriptions object. The Source API returns detailed information on the organizations that provide the data contained in the NVD dataset, including every possible {sourceIdentifier} value.

Request all CVE with the data source "cve@mitre.org"

https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0?sourceIdentifier=cve@mitre.org


versionEnd & versionEndType (optional)
{ending version}

including

excluding

The virtualMatchString parameter may be combined with versionEnd and versionEndType to return only the CVEs associated with CPEs in specific version ranges. If filtering by the ending version, versionEnd, versionEndType, and virtualMatchString are REQUIRED. Requests that include versionEnd cannot also include a version component in the virtualMatchString.

Request all CVE affiliated with version 2.6 of a specific CPE

https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0?virtualMatchString=cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel&versionStart=2.6&versionStartType=including&versionEnd=2.6&versionEndType=including


versionStart & versionStartType (optional)
{starting version}

including

excluding

The virtualMatchString parameter may be combined with versionStart and versionStartType to return only the CVEs associated with CPEs in specific version ranges. If filtering by the starting version, versionStart, versionStartType, and virtualMatchString are REQUIRED. Requests that include versionStart cannot also include a version component in the virtualMatchString.

Request all CVE affiliated with versions 2.2 through 2.5.x of a specific CPE

https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0?virtualMatchString=cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel&versionStart=2.2&versionStartType=including&versionEnd=2.6&versionEndType=excluding


virtualMatchString (optional)
{cpe match string}

This parameter filters CVE more broadly than cpeName. The exact value of {cpe match string} is compared against the CPE Match Criteria present on all CVE applicability statements.

CPE Match Criteria comes in two forms: CPE Match Strings and CPE Match String Ranges. Both are abstract concepts that are then correlated to CPE URIS in the Official CPE Dictionary. Unlike a CPE Name, match strings and match string ranges do not require a value in the part, vendor, product, or version components. The CVE API returns CPE Match Criteria within the configurations object.

CPE Match String Ranges are only supported for the version component and only when virtualMatchString is combined with versionStart, versionStartType, versionEnd, and versionEndType.

cpeName is a simpler alternative for many use cases. When both cpeName and virtualMatchString are provided, only the cpeName is used.

Request all CVE where the associated CPE's language component denotes the German language version of a product.

https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0?virtualMatchString=cpe:2.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:de


+ Response
CVE Change History API
The CVE Change History API is used to easily retrieve information on changes made to a single CVE or a collection of CVE from the NVD. This API provides additional transparency to the work of the NVD, allowing users to easily monitor when and why vulnerabilities change.

The NVD has existed in some form since 1999 and the fidelity of this information has changed several times over the decades. Earlier records may not contain the level of detail available with more recent CVE records. This is most apparent on CVE records prior to 2015.

The URL stem for retrieving CVE information is shown below.
